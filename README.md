# Cost-Prediction-Algo

Cars dataset is provided having the major qualities such as mileage, power, fuel_type etc. Linear Regressor and Random Forest Regressor algorithm are used to predict the cost of the cars and then the difference between the two regressors prediction is visualised. 
Linear Regressor is having a score of 69.7% and the Random Forest Classifier is having a score of 91.3 on training data.

Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Sklearn's Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressors are used
